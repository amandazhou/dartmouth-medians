Academic departments at Dartmouth vary when it comes to per class median enrollment and average class grade. However, there is a trend that humanities departments tend to have lower enrollment and higher medians than social science and STEM departments.

Description:

      While there is a lot of variation in average grade and median class enrollment among the three department types, humanities departments tends to dominate the upper left of the graph where the departments tend to have the highest grades and lowest median. In fact, the only departments with an average median grade above an A- are humanities classes. STEM and social sciences departments tend to have lower grades and larger classes. The impact of this trend must be weighed against the size of the points or the number of classes the department offers annually. Some departments with very high grade medians offer only a few classes a year compared to others.
      Only the departments that offer more than 25 classes per years (four trimesters) were labeled. The departments with the lowest average median are the chemistry, math, biology and economics. The departments with the highest average medians are theatre, music, studio art and Russian. Coincidentally, the economics department offers the most classes per year and has the highest median class enrollment among the departments represented. 

Data Sources:

The data was taken from the Dartmouth Office of the Registrarâ€™s website, which lists medians (www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/transcript/medians/). The data for class information was scraped with OutWitHub Pro Outwit Hub. The first dataset, which consists of class information between the summer 2015 and summer 2017 semesters was collected on January 12, 2018, before the information for the fall 2017 term was available. The second dataset, which consists of information for the fall 2017 semester, was collected on February 20, 2018.
